X3DJSAIL: X3D Java Scene Access Interface Library

X3DJSAIL, the X3D Java Scene Access Interface Library is a set of strongly typed
Java application programming interfaces (APIs) providing programmer access to an
X3D scene graph. Two open-source Java packages are included that contain X3D SAI
interfaces and support the X3D Specifications for Java programmers. 

* org.web3d.x3d.jsail provides concrete classes to create and modify X3D scenes
  using Java objects, suitable for a variety of independent programs.

* org.web3d.x3d.sai provides SAI interfaces suitable for X3D Script node
  compilation, with subsequent scene re-use within a variety of X3D players.

Goals include making it easy to create an X3D scene graph using Java,
while also making it hard to create an incorrect or invalid X3D model.

Design details for the Java SAI Library can be found in the project summary
and javadoc documentation, bundled locally and published online.
